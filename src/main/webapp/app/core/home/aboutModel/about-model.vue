            <ul>
              <li style="padding-bottom:1em">Develop a conceptual model that will facilitate analysing the relationship between MH issues faced by SMEs’ staff, factors and various job dimensions contributing to these issues, and its impact on both the staff and business productivity during the pandemic, through a multi-stage survey.</li>
              <li style="padding-bottom:1em">Develop a COVID-19 employee well-being framework comprising of strategies, practices and interventions, considering SMEs' needs and constraints, and conduct a longitudinal study with SMEs to evaluate its effectiveness and impact towards increasing the resilience and productivity of SMEs’ workforce in varying work contexts during and after the pandemic.</li>
              <li>Develop a COVID-19 MH application to monitor the MH conditions of SMEs’ workforce and pilot it with the longitudinal study, to show how the data collected through the app will enable each individual SME to understand its staff needs, introspect their well-being, that will facilitate customizing the framework, i.e. objectively putting in place practices, strategies and interventions to address employee MH, well-being and firm’s productivity related issues.</li>

            <h4><b>Work Package 1: Development and validation of a conceptual audit model</b></h4>
            <p><b>Study Context:</b> The conceptual model will examine  the impact of staff MH problems, well-being issues, and various
              factors (including work related) affecting these during COVID-19, on staff and business productivity, and the UK economy.
              A survey instrument will be designed to examine the relationship between several constructs including: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Impact of COVID on - job roles, environment, expectations and several dimensions, staff MH and well-being, training needs,
                technology use, business productivity and supply chain resilience</li>
              <li>Individual strategies and SMEs’ management strategy to alleviate MH problems, including transition from remote working back to the office</li>
              <li>Factors beyond the employer’s control affecting staff MH, and critical measures to address them</li>
              <li>Challenges faced by the different age groups</li>
